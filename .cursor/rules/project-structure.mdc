# Project Structure Guide

This project uses a typical React Native/Expo structure:

- The main entry point is [App.tsx](mdc:App.tsx).
- TypeScript configuration is in [tsconfig.json](mdc:tsconfig.json).
- Project dependencies are managed in [package.json](mdc:package.json).
- Static assets are stored in the [assets/](mdc:assets) directory.
- The [index.ts](mdc:index.ts) file is used for Expo/React Native bootstrapping.

Follow this structure for adding new features or configuration files.
